            <h2>A bit of the Alhambra Palace's history</h2>
            <p>The Alhambra (/ælˈhæmbrə/, Spanish: [aˈlambɾa]; Arabic: الْحَمْرَاء, romanized: al-ḥamrāʼ ) is a palace
                and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It is one of the most famous monuments of
                Islamic architecture and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic Islamic world, in addition to
                containing notable examples of Spanish Renaissance architecture</p>
            <p>The complex was begun in 1238 by Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir and founder of the
                Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim state of Al-Andalus. It was built on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of
                the Sierra Nevada which had been the site of earlier fortresses and of the 11th-century palace of Samuel
                ibn Naghrillah. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site. The most significant construction
                campaigns, which gave the royal palaces much of their definitive character, took place in the 14th
                century during the reigns of Yusuf I and Muhammad V. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista
                in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received
                royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, Charles V
                commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was
                left uncompleted in the early 17th century. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries,
                with its buildings occupied by squatters, the Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon
                I, whose troops destroyed parts of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then
                other American and Northern European Romantic travelers. The most influential of them was Washington
                Irving, whose Tales of the Alhambra (1832) brought international attention to the site. The Alhambra was
                one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the
                subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century. It is now one of Spain's major tourist
                attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
            <p>During the Nasrid era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of Granada below. It
                contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a Friday mosque, hammams (public baths), roads,
                houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and
                citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where
                they commanded views over the Albaicín quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the Mexuar, the
                Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to
                visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the
                Alhambra's western tip is the Alcazaba fortress. Multiple smaller towers and fortified gates are also
                located along the Alhambra's walls. Outside the Alhambra walls and located nearby to the east is the
                Generalife, a former Nasrid country estate and summer palace accompanied by historic orchards and modern
                landscaped gardens.</p>
            <p>The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over
                previous centuries. It is characterized by the use of the courtyard as a central space and basic unit
                around which other halls and rooms were organized. Courtyards typically had water features at their
                center, such as a reflective pool or a fountain. Decoration was focused on the inside of the building
                and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls.
                Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic inscriptions were the main types of decorative motifs.
                Additionally, "stalactite"-like sculpting, known as muqarnas, was used for three-dimensional features
                like vaulted ceilings.</p>

                    <p>Will reopen to the public again this summer and will return to its historical image with white
                        marble
                        from Macael.</p>

                    <h3>Space of the month: Torre de los Picos - Alhambra</h3>
                    <p>The Tower of the Points (Torre de los Picos) received this name because its merlons end in brick
                        pyramids. It was built in the late 13th century or beginning of the 14th and it is therefore
                        surprising to see its Gothic style.</p>

                    <h3>Spanish paradise: gardens of the Alhambra at the New York Botanical Garden</h3>
                    <p>In the late Middle Ages, the Moors sought to create their own version of paradise on Earth at a
                        place
                        they called the Alhambra in what is now Granada, Spain. Seven centuries later, few have come
                        close
                        to matching the Moors’ efforts, but the folks at the New York Botanical Garden are at least
                        willing to
                        give it a shot—recreating elements of the famous Gardens of Alhambra with this exciting, ongoing
                        flower
                        exhibition at the Haupt Conservatory. Flamenco music, Spanish cuisine and the poetry of Federico
                        Lorca will add to the ambiance in and around the gardens throughout the summer.</p>

                        most
                        important of the Alhambra. The rest of the year is closed for conservation reasons</p>
