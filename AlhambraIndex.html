            <h2>A bit of the Alhambra Palace's history</h2>
            <p>The <b>Alhambra</b> (<i>/ælˈhæmbrə/</i>, Spanish: <i>[aˈlambɾa]; Arabic:</i> الْحَمْرَاء,
                <i>romanized:</i> al-ḥamrāʼ ) is a palace
                and fortress complex located in <b>Granada, Andalusia, Spain</b>. It is one of the most famous monuments
                of
                <b>Islamic architecture</b> and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic <i>Islamic world</i>,
                in addition to
                containing notable examples of Spanish <b>Renaissance architecture</b>
            </p>
            <img id="door" src="images/puerta.jpg" alt="door">
            <p>The complex was begun in <b>1238</b> by <i>Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar</i>, the first <i>Nasrid</i> emir and
                founder of the <i>Emirate of Granada</i>, the last Muslim state of <b>Al-Andalus</b>. It was built on
                the Sabika hill,
                an outcrop of the <b>Sierra Nevada</b> which had been the site of earlier fortresses and of the
                11th-century palace of
                <i>Samuel ibn Naghrillah</i>. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site. The most significant
                construction campaigns, which gave the royal palaces much of their definitive character, took place in
                the 14th
                century during the reigns of <i>Yusuf I</i> and <i>Muhammad V</i>. After the conclusion of the Christian
                <b>Reconquista</b> in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i> (where
                <i>Christopher
                    Columbus</i> received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered.
                In 1526,
                <i>Charles V</i> commissioned a new <b>Renaissance-style palace</b> in direct juxtaposition with the
                Nasrid palaces, but
                it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for
                centuries,
                with its buildings occupied by squatters, the Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of
                <i>Napoleon I</i>,
                whose troops destroyed parts of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then
                other American and Northern European Romantic travelers. The most influential of them was <i>Washington
                    Irving</i>, whose <i>Tales of the Alhambra</i> (1832) brought international attention to the site.
                The Alhambra was
                one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the
                subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century. It is now one of Spain's major tourist
                attractions and a <b>UNESCO World Heritage Site</b>.
            </p>
            <img id="hand" src="images/mano.jpg" alt="hand">
            <p>During the Nasrid era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of Granada below. It
                contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a <i>Friday mosque, hammams</i> (public baths),
                roads,
                houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and
                citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where
                they commanded views over the <b>Albaicín</b> quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the
                Mexuar, the
                Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to
                visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the
                Alhambra's western tip is the Alcazaba fortress. Multiple smaller towers and fortified gates are also
                located along the Alhambra's walls. Outside the Alhambra walls and located nearby to the east is the
                <b>Generalife</b>, a former Nasrid country estate and summer palace accompanied by historic orchards and
                modern
                landscaped gardens.
            </p>
            <img id="key" src="images/llave.jpg" alt="key">
            <p>The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over
                previous centuries. It is characterized by the use of the courtyard as a central space and basic unit
                around which other halls and rooms were organized. Courtyards typically had water features at their
                center, such as a reflective pool or a fountain. Decoration was focused on the inside of the building
                and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls.
                Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic inscriptions were the main types of decorative motifs.
                Additionally, "stalactite"-like sculpting, known as muqarnas, was used for three-dimensional features
                like vaulted ceilings.</p>

                        they called the Alhambra in what is now Granada, Spain. Seven centuries later, few have come
                        close
                        to matching the Moors’ efforts, but the folks at the New York Botanical Garden are at least
                        willing to
                        give it a shot—recreating elements of the famous Gardens of Alhambra with this exciting, ongoing
